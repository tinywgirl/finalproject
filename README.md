Project description:
Jeopardy is question and answer game. This program reads  a file with questions, prices, dates, air number, etc. 
Asks one question at a time, adds the price won if answer is correct. You can keep playing indefinitely.

instalation: 
Simply download all the .cpp and .csv files and run the program on your IDE of preference.

Challenges and solutions:
-Random bugs on the run time -> still ongoing
-The way the .cvs is written (having \, “, etc) -> had to edit the file, create vectors to read through it and edit.
-Couldn’t generate different random numbers -> srand(time(0));
-Graphics library -> still ongoing
